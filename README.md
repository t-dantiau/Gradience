> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a new work in progress version of Gradience which aims to be a fully featured replacement but which isn't supported or approved by any member of the former Gradience team. I hope that the Gradience community will use this new version of Gradience (φοῖνιξ Edition). I kept the name Gradience because I liked it, but I'm open to any suggestions about the design side of this upcoming theming app
